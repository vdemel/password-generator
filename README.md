# Description:

This password generator allows an employee to generate a random password based on criteria that they choose.  After they click the "generate password" button they will answer a series of questions about the length of the password and what types of characters they would like their password to contain.  Once they have answered the questions, and chosen a minimum of the defaults required by the program security, a random password will be generated for them.
